# Beamer theme

A clean [Beamer](https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home) theme
I made up for some of my presentations.  Made to use with [XeLatex](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex)

# Acknowledgments

The color palette is "Thought Provoking" from [Miss Anthropy](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/694737/Thought_Provoking).

I also took some inspiration from [Seth Brown's custom beamer theme](http://www.drbunsen.org/custom-beamer-theme.html).
